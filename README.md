Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the Finance Excel Workbook Sample dataset
Hello Everyone,

I made this Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the Finance Excel Workbook Sample dataset downloaded online.

The Power BI dashboard is totally interactive, whatever data point you choose, the other data chart changes accordingly.

This is one of the best way to know all the information one needs to about the past and present financial data.

Problem Statement

The goal of this Power BI Dashboard Project is to analyse the financial performance of a company using the provided Microsoft Sample Data.

To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

Sections in the Report

Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :

Report Data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show Particular Data.
It has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.
It has a Clustered Bar Chart with Year on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing Profit Quarterly.
And Lastly, It has a Area Chart showing Months on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing profit Monthly.
I have also included a Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicer's.
To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.
